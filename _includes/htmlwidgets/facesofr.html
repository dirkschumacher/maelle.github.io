This week I was impressed by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/DEJPett/status/842330248549158913) where Daniel Pett, Digital Humanities Lead at the British Museum, presented a collage of Twitter profile pics of all his colleagues. He made this piece of art using R (for collecting the usernames) and Python. I'm a bit of an R fanatic (or a Python dummy...) so I decided to write a code in R only to make a collage of profile pics of Twitter #rstats users.

Note: if you're interested in Daniel Pett's code, the data gathering is [here](https://github.com/BritishMuseumDH/BMTwitter) and the montage code is [here](https://github.com/BritishMuseumDH/scripts/blob/master/imageDownloadFromCSV.py).

# Getting the users

Once again I'll use `rtweet`! In case you've been using `twitteR`, note that `twitteR` maintainer is currently passing the torch to `rtweet` so you'd better switch packages.


```r
library("rtweet")
library("dplyr")
library("magick")
library("httr")
library("stringr")
library("purrr")
```

```r
users <- search_users(q= '#rstats',
                      n = 1000,
                      parse = TRUE)
users <- unique(users)

```

I _think_ that doing this I got only profiles whose description includes "rstats" or "#rstats". Moreover, although I got 1,000 results, many of them were duplicates, so in the end I had about 450 #rstats Twitter users.



# Gathering profile pics

This is the part where I felt slightly creepy downloading pictures of so many people.

I first had to create the link to each person's profile page.

```r
users <- mutate(users,
                where = paste0("https://twitter.com/",
                               screen_name))
                               
```

Then I wrote a function for getting the profile pic for each user. I worked for everyone except 1) eggs and 2) a person whose profile pic had no extension, so I was quite satisfied with the result.

Update: Daniel Pett told me I could have used the column "profile_image_url" of the data.frame obtained from `rtweet::search_users`... I had completely missed that column! Thanks a lot!

```r
get_piclink <- function(df){
  content <- httr::GET(df$where)
  content <- httr::content(content, as = "text")
  image <- str_extract(content,
                       "class=\"ProfileAvatar-image \" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/.*\\..*\" alt")
  image <- str_replace(image, "class=\"ProfileAvatar-image \" src=\"", "")
  image <- str_replace(image, "..alt", "")
  return(image)
}

users <- by_row(users, get_piclink,
                .to = "piclink", .collate = "cols")

readr::write_csv(users, path = "users.csv")
```

After getting the links I could start saving the pictures, in a small 50px x 50px format. At that point I started using the [`magick` package](https://github.com/ropensci/magick), a real game changer for image manipulation in R!

```r
save_image <- function(df){
  image <- try(image_read(df$piclink), silent = TRUE)
  if(class(image)[1] != "try-error"){
    image %>%
      image_scale("50x50") %>%
      image_write(paste0("data/2017-03-19-facesofr_users_images/", df$screen_name,".jpg"))
  }
  
}

users <- filter(users, !is.na(piclink))
users <- split(users, 1:nrow(users))
walk(users, save_image)

```

I got 448 images. 

# Preparing the collage itself

I want to take a minute thinking about myself in elementary school. I am left-handed and I had scissors for right-handed people that I used with my left hand because no one in my family or school knew any better. I was therefore very bad at collages because of the cutting part. Had I known that I'd do collages with a computer as a grown-up, I would have been less sad to have to skip the break to keep on slowly cutting pieces of paper! (Note: I actually had a very happy childhood.)

Back to R talk now! For doing the collage I had to know how many columns and rows I wanted. For this I factorized the number of pics I had. Note that I also re-sampled the images, because I didn't want all the R-Ladies chapters and their beautiful purple logo to end up near each other in the collage.


```r
files <- dir("data/2017-03-19-facesofr_users_images/", full.names = TRUE)
set.seed(1)
files <- sample(files, length(files))
gmp::factorize(length(files))
```

```
## Big Integer ('bigz') object of length 7:
## [1] 2 2 2 2 2 2 7
```

Based on this I chose this format:


```r
no_rows <- 28
no_cols <- 16
```

In `magick` there's a function for appending images, `image_append`, from which you get either a row or a column depending on the `stack` argument. I first created all columns.



```r
make_column <- function(i, files, no_rows){
  image_read(files[(i*no_rows+1):((i+1)*no_rows)]) %>%
  image_append(stack = TRUE) %>%
    image_write(paste0("cols/", i, ".jpg"))
}

walk(0:(no_cols-1), make_column, files = files,
    no_rows = no_rows)
```

And finally, I appended the columns!


```r
image_read(dir("cols/", full.names = TRUE)) %>%
image_append(stack = FALSE) %>%
  image_write("2017-03-19-facesofr.jpg")
```

# The end

Here is the result, where many, many R users are most certainly missing. Besides, can we talk about these accounts with the old R logo? They make me feel old, while the R-Ladies logo make me happy. Too bad [Forwards](https://twitter.com/R_Forwards) wasn't included, because their logo is really pretty.

Now you can try doing the same with your followers, the people you follow, or making a doormat with base plot advocates.
